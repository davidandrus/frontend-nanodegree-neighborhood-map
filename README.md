frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood map
===============================

This is a take on the neighborhood map, but instead I provide information for all of the countries of the world.

## To run app

### on github pages
visithttps://davidandrus.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map

### locally
1. clone repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. open the location shown in the command or clone repo and then open `index.html` in a browser

### To play game:
* use keyboard arrows to move your character
* avoid the enemy beetles if you get to the water you will score
* if you do collide an enemy beetle you will be sent back to the start
* the more times you get to the water in a single life the higher the score multilpier
* die 5 times and it's game over
